**` Student at William & Mary (Data Science/GIS/Biology)`**

I’m a Data Science student at William & Mary specializing in GIS and spatial analytics, with a passion for applying geospatial tools to environmental challenges. From mapping harmful algal blooms in Alaska with Google Earth Engine to analyzing shoreline habitats at VIMS, I turn complex ecological data into clear, actionable insights. Outside of research, I enjoy cycling, running, and exploring the outdoors.
